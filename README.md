# MunroQuery

Munro Query it will help you to query and filter Munro Data.


### TODO:

- Domain layer with Data protocol that will be used to Query list.

- Empy Query

- Sort by height
- Sort by name

- Filter by Hill type
- Filter by Min height
- Filter by Max height

Pre req: 
- Can have 0 to all queries
- Order matters (makes sense from developer perspective)
- Error throw in case invalid query:  repeat query, query with boundaries, incompatible queries (min and max shoudl not cross boundaries),etc.
